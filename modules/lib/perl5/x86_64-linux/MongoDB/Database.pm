=head1 NAME

MongoDB::Database - A MongoDB Database

=head1 VERSION

version v1.8.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # get a Database object via MongoDB::MongoClient
    my $db   = $client->get_database("foo");

    # get a Collection via the Database object
    my $coll = $db->get_collection("people");

    # run a command on a database
    my $res = $db->run_command([ismaster => 1]);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class models a MongoDB database.  Use it to construct
L<MongoDB::Collection> objects. It also provides the L</run_command> method and
some convenience methods that use it.

Generally, you never construct one of these directly with C<new>.  Instead, you
call C<get_database> on a L<MongoDB::MongoClient> object.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Error handling

Unless otherwise explicitly documented, all methods throw exceptions if
an error occurs.  The error types are documented in L<MongoDB::Error>.

To catch and handle errors, the L<Try::Tiny> and L<Safe::Isa> modules
are recommended:

    use Try::Tiny;
    use Safe::Isa; # provides $_isa

    try {
        $db->run_command( @command )
    }
    catch {
        if ( $_->$_isa("MongoDB::DuplicateKeyError" ) {
            ...
        }
        else {
            ...
        }
    };

To retry failures automatically, consider using L<Try::Tiny::Retry>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

The name of the database.

=head2 read_preference

A L<MongoDB::ReadPreference> object.  It may be initialized with a string
corresponding to one of the valid read preference modes or a hash reference
that will be coerced into a new MongoDB::ReadPreference object.
By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::MongoClient> object.

=head2 write_concern

A L<MongoDB::WriteConcern> object.  It may be initialized with a hash
reference that will be coerced into a new MongoDB::WriteConcern object.
By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::MongoClient> object.

=head2 read_concern

A L<MongoDB::ReadConcern> object.  May be initialized with a hash
reference or a string that will be coerced into the level of read
concern.

By default it will be inherited from a L<MongoDB::MongoClient> object.

=head2 max_time_ms

Specifies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the server should use
for working on a query.

B<Note>: this will only be used for server versions 2.6 or greater, as that
was when the C<$maxTimeMS> meta-operator was introduced.

=head2 bson_codec

An object that provides the C<encode_one> and C<decode_one> methods, such as
from L<MongoDB::BSON>.  It may be initialized with a hash reference that will
be coerced into a new MongoDB::BSON object.  By default it will be inherited
from a L<MongoDB::MongoClient> object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 list_collections

    $result = $coll->list_collections( $filter );
    $result = $coll->list_collections( $filter, $options );

Returns a L<MongoDB::QueryResult> object to iterate over collection description
documents.  These will contain C<name> and C<options> keys like so:

    use boolean;

    {
        name => "my_capped_collection",
        options => {
            capped => true,
            size => 10485760,
        }
    },

An optional filter document may be provided, which cause only collection
description documents matching a filter expression to be returned.  See the
L<listCollections command
documentation|http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/listCollections/>
for more details on filtering for specific collections.

A hash reference of options may be provided. Valid keys include:

=over 4

=item *

C<batchSize> – the number of documents to return per batch.

=item *

C<maxTimeMS> – the maximum amount of time in milliseconds to allow the command to run.  (Note, this will be ignored for servers before version 2.6.)

=back

=head2 collection_names

    my @collections = $database->collection_names;
    my @collections = $database->collection_names( $filter );

Returns the list of collections in this database.

An optional filter document may be provided, which cause only collection
description documents matching a filter expression to be returned.  See the
L<listCollections command
documentation|http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/listCollections/>
for more details on filtering for specific collections.

B<Warning:> if the number of collections is very large, this may return
a very large result.  Either pass an appropriate filter, or use
L</list_collections> to iterate over collections instead.

=head2 get_collection, coll

    my $collection = $database->get_collection('foo');
    my $collection = $database->get_collection('foo', $options);
    my $collection = $database->coll('foo', $options);

Returns a L<MongoDB::Collection> for the given collection name within this
database.

It takes an optional hash reference of options that are passed to the
L<MongoDB::Collection> constructor.

The C<coll> method is an alias for C<get_collection>.

=head2 get_gridfsbucket, gfs

    my $grid = $database->get_gridfsbucket;
    my $grid = $database->get_gridfsbucket($options);
    my $grid = $database->gfs($options);

This method returns a L<MongoDB::GridFSBucket> object for storing and
retrieving files from the database.

It takes an optional hash reference of options that are passed to the
L<MongoDB::GridFSBucket> constructor.

See L<MongoDB::GridFSBucket> for more information.

The C<gfs> method is an alias for C<get_gridfsbucket>.

=head2 get_gridfs (DEPRECATED)

    my $grid = $database->get_gridfs;
    my $grid = $database->get_gridfs("fs");
    my $grid = $database->get_gridfs("fs", $options);

The L<MongoDB::GridFS> class has been deprecated in favor of the new MongoDB
driver-wide standard GridFS API, available via L<MongoDB::GridFSBucket> and
the C<get_gridfsbucket>/C<gfs> methods.

This method returns a L<MongoDB::GridFS> for storing and retrieving files
from the database.  Default prefix is "fs", making C<$grid-E<gt>files>
"fs.files" and C<$grid-E<gt>chunks> "fs.chunks".

It takes an optional hash reference of options that are passed to the
L<MongoDB::GridFS> constructor.

See L<MongoDB::GridFS> for more information.

=head2 drop

    $database->drop;

Deletes the database.

=head2 run_command

    my $output = $database->run_command([ some_command => 1 ]);

    my $output = $database->run_command(
        [ some_command => 1 ],
        { mode => 'secondaryPreferred' }
    );

This method runs a database command.  The first argument must be a document
with the command and its arguments.  It should be given as an array reference
of key-value pairs or a L<Tie::IxHash> object with the command name as the
first key.  The use of a hash reference will only reliably work for commands
without additional parameters.

By default, commands are run with a read preference of 'primary'.  An optional
second argument may specify an alternative read preference.  If given, it must
be a L<MongoDB::ReadPreference> object or a hash reference that can be used to
construct one.

It returns the output of the command (a hash reference) on success or throws a
L<MongoDB::DatabaseError|MongoDB::Error/MongoDB::DatabaseError> exception if
the command fails.

For a list of possible database commands, run:

    my $commands = $db->run_command([listCommands => 1]);

There are a few examples of database commands in the
L<MongoDB::Examples/"DATABASE COMMANDS"> section.  See also core documentation
on database commands: L<http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/commands>.

they will warn when used, then will eventually be removed.
