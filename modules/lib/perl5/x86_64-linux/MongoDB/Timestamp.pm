MongoDB::Timestamp - Replication timestamp

=head1 VERSION

version v1.8.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an internal type used for replication.  It is not for storing dates,
times, or timestamps in the traditional sense.  Unless you are looking to mess
with MongoDB's replication internals, the class you are probably looking for is
L<DateTime>.  See L<MongoDB::DataTypes> for more information.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 sec

Seconds since epoch.

=head2 inc

Incrementing field.
