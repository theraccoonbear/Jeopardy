=head1 NAME

MongoDB::ReadConcern - Encapsulate and validate a read concern

=head1 VERSION

version v1.8.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $rc = MongoDB::ReadConcern->new(); # no defaults

    $rc = MongoDB::ReadConcern->new(
        level    => 'local',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Read Concern describes the constraints that MongoDB must satisfy when reading
data.  Read Concern was introduced in MongoDB 3.2.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 level

The read concern level determines the consistency level required
of data being read.

The default level is C<undef>, which means the server will use its configured
default.

If the level is set to "local", reads will return the latest data a server has
locally.

Additional levels are storage engine specific.  See L<Read
Concern|http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/search/?query=readConcern> in the MongoDB
documentation for more details.

This may be set in a connection string with the the C<readConcernLevel> option.
