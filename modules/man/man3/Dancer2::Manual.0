.SH "NAME"
Dancer2::Manual \- A gentle introduction to Dancer2
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.205000
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Dancer2 is a free and open source web application framework written in Perl.
.PP
It's a complete rewrite of Dancer, based on Moo and using a more
robust and extensible fully-OO design.
.PP
It's designed to be powerful and flexible, but also easy to use \- getting up
and running with your web app is trivial, and an ecosystem of adaptors for
common template engines, session storage, logging methods, serializers, and
plugins to make common tasks easy means you can do what you want to do, your
way, easily.
.SH "INSTALL"
.IX Header "INSTALL"
Installation of Dancer2 is simple:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall Dancer2\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Thanks to the magic of cpanminus, if you do not have \s-1CPAN\s0.pm configured, or
just want a quickfire way to get running, the following should work, at
least on Unix-like systems:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    wget \-O \- http://cpanmin.us | sudo perl \- Dancer2
.Ve
.PP
(If you don't have root access, omit the 'sudo', and cpanminus will install
Dancer2 and prereqs into \f(CW\*(C`~/perl5\*(C'\fR.)
.SH "BOOTSTRAPPING A NEW APP"

.PP
It creates a directory named after the name of the app, along with a
configuration file, a views directory (where your templates and layouts
will live), an environments directory (where environment-specific
settings live), a module containing the actual guts of your application, and
a script to start it. A default skeleton is used to bootstrap the new
application, but you can use the \f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR option to provide another skeleton.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ dancer2 \-a MyApp \-s ~/mydancerskel
.Ve
.PP
For an example of a skeleton directory check the default one available in
the \f(CW\*(C`share/\*(C'\fR directory of your Dancer2 distribution.
.PP
(In what follows we will refer to the directory in which you have created your
Dancer2 application \*(-- \fIe.g.,\fR what \f(CW\*(C`MyApp\*(C'\fR was above \*(-- as the
\&\f(CW\*(C`appdir\*(C'\fR.)
.PP
Because Dancer2 is a \s-1PSGI\s0 web application framework, you can use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`plackup\*(C'\fR tool (provided by Plack) for launching the application:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    plackup \-p 5000 bin/app.psgi
.Ve
.PP

.PP
.Vb 1
\&    http://localhost:5000
.Ve
.SH "USAGE"
.IX Header "USAGE"
When Dancer2 is imported to a script, that script becomes a webapp, and at
this point, all the script has to do is declare a list of \fBroutes\fR. A
route handler is composed by an \s-1HTTP\s0 method, a path pattern and a code
block. \f(CW\*(C`strict\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`warnings\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR pragmas are also imported with
Dancer2.
.PP
The code block given to the route handler has to return a string which will
be used as the content to render to the client.
.PP
Routes are defined for a given \s-1HTTP\s0 method. For each method supported, a
keyword is exported by the module.
.SS "\s-1HTTP\s0 Methods"
.IX Subsection "HTTP Methods"
Here are some of the standard \s-1HTTP\s0 methods which you can use to define your
route handlers.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1GET\s0\fR The \s-1GET\s0 method retrieves information, and is the most common
.Sp
\&\s-1GET\s0 requests should be used for typical \*(L"fetch\*(R" requests \- retrieving
information. They should not be used for requests which change data on the
server or have other effects.
.Sp
When defining a route handler for the \s-1GET\s0 method, Dancer2 automatically
defines a route handler for the \s-1HEAD\s0 method (in order to honour \s-1HEAD\s0
requests for each of your \s-1GET\s0 route handlers).
.Sp
To define a \s-1GET\s0 action, use the get keyword.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1POST\s0\fR The \s-1POST\s0 method is used to create a resource on the server.
.Sp
To define a \s-1POST\s0 action, use the post keyword.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1PUT\s0\fR The \s-1PUT\s0 method is used to replace an existing resource.
.Sp
To define a \s-1PUT\s0 action, use the put keyword.
.Sp
a \s-1PUT\s0 request should replace the existing resource with that specified \- for
instance \- if you wanted to just update an email address for a user, you'd
have to specify all attributes of the user again; to make a partial update,
a \s-1PATCH\s0 request is used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1PATCH\s0\fR The \s-1PATCH\s0 method updates some attributes of an existing resource.
.Sp
To define a \s-1PATCH\s0 action, use the patch keyword.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1DELETE\s0\fR The \s-1DELETE\s0 method requests that the origin server delete the
resource identified by the Request-URI.
.Sp
To define a \s-1DELETE\s0 action, use the del keyword.
.PP
\fIHandling multiple \s-1HTTP\s0 request methods\fR
.IX Subsection "Handling multiple HTTP request methods"
.PP
Routes can use \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR to match all, or a specified list of \s-1HTTP\s0 methods.
.PP
The following will match any \s-1HTTP\s0 request to the path \f(CW\*(C`/myaction\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    any \*(Aq/myaction\*(Aq => sub {
\&        # code
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The following will match \s-1GET\s0 or \s-1POST\s0 requests to \f(CW\*(C`/myaction\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    any [\*(Aqget\*(Aq, \*(Aqpost\*(Aq] => \*(Aq/myaction\*(Aq => sub {
\&        # code
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
For convenience, any route which matches \s-1GET\s0 requests will also match \s-1HEAD\s0
requests.
.SS "Route Handlers"
.IX Subsection "Route Handlers"
The route action is the code reference declared. It can access parameters
through the specific \f(CW\*(C`route_parameters\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`query_parameters\*(C'\fR, and 
\&\f(CW\*(C`body_parameters\*(C'\fR keywords, which return a Hash::MultiValue object. 
This hashref is a merge of the route pattern matches and the request params.
.PP
You can have more details about how params are built and how to access them
in the Dancer2::Core::Request documentation.
.PP
\fIDeclaring Routes\fR
.IX Subsection "Declaring Routes"
.PP
To control what happens when a web request is received by your webapp,
you'll need to declare \f(CW\*(C`routes\*(C'\fR. A route declaration indicates which \s-1HTTP\s0
method(s) it is valid for, the path it matches (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`/foo/bar\*(C'\fR), and a
coderef to execute, which returns the response.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/hello/:name\*(Aq => sub {
\&        return "Hi there " . route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqname\*(Aq);
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
The above route specifies that, for \s-1GET\s0 requests to \f(CW\*(C`/hello/...\*(C'\fR, the code
block provided should be executed.
.PP
\fIRetrieving request parameters\fR
.IX Subsection "Retrieving request parameters"
.PP
The query_parameters,
route_parameters, and
body_parameters keywords provide
a Hash::MultiValue result from the three different parameters.
.PP
\fINamed matching\fR
.IX Subsection "Named matching"
.PP
A route pattern can contain one or more tokens (a word prefixed with ':').
Each token found in a route pattern is used as a named-pattern match. Any
match will be set in the route parameters.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/hello/:name\*(Aq => sub {
\&        "Hey " . route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqname\*(Aq) . ", welcome here!";
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Tokens can be optional, for example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/hello/:name?\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my $name = route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqname\*(Aq) //= \*(AqWhoever you are\*(Aq;
\&        "Hello there, $name";
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
\fIWildcard Matching\fR
.IX Subsection "Wildcard Matching"
.PP
A route can contain a wildcard (represented by a \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR). Each wildcard match
will be placed in a list, which the \f(CW\*(C`splat\*(C'\fR keyword returns.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/download/*.*\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my ($file, $ext) = splat;
\&        # do something with $file.$ext here
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
An extensive, greedier wildcard represented by \f(CW\*(C`**\*(C'\fR (A.K.A. \*(L"megasplat\*(R") can be
used to define a route. The additional path is broken down and returned as an
arrayref:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/entry/*/tags/**\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my ( $entry_id, $tags ) = splat;
\&        my @tags = @{$tags};
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`splat\*(C'\fR keyword in the above example for the route \fI/entry/1/tags/one/two\fR
would set \f(CW$entry_id\fR to \f(CW1\fR and \f(CW$tags\fR to \f(CW\*(C`[\*(Aqone\*(Aq, \*(Aqtwo\*(Aq]\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIMixed named and wildcard matching\fR
.IX Subsection "Mixed named and wildcard matching"
.PP
A route can combine named (token) matching and wildcard matching.
This is useful when chaining actions:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/team/:team/**\*(Aq => sub {
\&        var team => route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqteam\*(Aq);
\&        pass;
\&    };
\&
\&    prefix \*(Aq/team/:team\*(Aq;
\&
\&    get \*(Aq/player/*\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my ($player) = splat;
\&
\&        # etc...
\&    };
\&
\&    get \*(Aq/score\*(Aq => sub {
\&        return score_for( vars\->{\*(Aqteam\*(Aq} );
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
\fIRegular Expression Matching\fR
.IX Subsection "Regular Expression Matching"
.PP
A route can be defined with a Perl regular expression.
.PP
In order to tell Dancer2 to consider the route as a real regexp, the route
must be defined explicitly with \f(CW\*(C`qr{}\*(C'\fR, like the following:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get qr{/hello/([\ew]+)} => sub {
\&        my ($name) = splat;
\&        return "Hello $name";
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
For Perl 5.10+, a route regex may use named capture groups. The \f(CW\*(C`captures\*(C'\fR
keyword will return a reference to a copy of \f(CW\*(C`%+\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIConditional Matching\fR
.IX Subsection "Conditional Matching"
.PP
Routes may include some matching conditions (on content_type, agent,
user_agent, content_length and path_info):
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/foo\*(Aq, {agent => \*(AqSongbird (\ed\e.\ed)[\ed\e/]*?\*(Aq} => sub {
\&      \*(Aqfoo method for songbird\*(Aq
\&    }
\&
\&    get \*(Aq/foo\*(Aq => sub {
\&      \*(Aqall browsers except songbird\*(Aq
\&    }
.Ve
.SS "Prefix"
.IX Subsection "Prefix"
A prefix can be defined for each route handler, like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    prefix \*(Aq/home\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
From here, any route handler is defined to /home/*
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    get \*(Aq/page1\*(Aq => sub {}; # will match \*(Aq/home/page1\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
You can unset the prefix value
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    prefix \*(Aq/\*(Aq; # or: prefix undef;
\&    get \*(Aq/page1\*(Aq => sub {}; # will match /page1
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, to prevent you from ever forgetting to undef the prefix, you
can use lexical prefix like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    prefix \*(Aq/home\*(Aq => sub {
\&      get \*(Aq/page1\*(Aq => sub {}; # will match \*(Aq/home/page1\*(Aq
\&    }; ## prefix reset to previous value on exit
\&
\&    get \*(Aq/page1\*(Aq => sub {}; # will match /page1
.Ve
.SS "Delayed responses (Async/Streaming)"
.IX Subsection "Delayed responses (Async/Streaming)"
Dancer2 can provide delayed (otherwise known as \fIasynchronous\fR) responses
using the \f(CW\*(C`delayed\*(C'\fR keyword. These responses are streamed, although you can
set the content all at once, if you prefer.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/status\*(Aq => sub {
\&        delayed {
\&            response_header \*(AqX\-Foo\*(Aq => \*(AqBar\*(Aq;
\&
\&            # flush headers (in case of streaming)
\&            flush;
\&
\&            # send content to the user
\&            content \*(AqHello, world!\*(Aq;
\&
\&            # you can write more content
\&            # all streaming
\&            content \*(AqHello, again!\*(Aq;
\&
\&            # when done, close the connection
\&            done;
\&
\&            # do whatever you want else, asynchronously
\&            # the user socket closed by now
\&            ...
\&        };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
If you are streaming (calling \f(CW\*(C`content\*(C'\fR several times), you must call
\&\f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR first. If you're sending only once, you don't need to call \f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Here is an example of using delayed responses with AnyEvent:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Dancer2;
\&    use AnyEvent;
\&
\&    my %timers;
\&    my $count = 5;
\&    get \*(Aq/drums\*(Aq => sub {
\&        delayed {
\&            print "Stretching...\en";
\&            flush; # necessary, since we\*(Aqre streaming
\&
\&            $timers{\*(AqSnare\*(Aq} = AE::timer 1, 1, delayed {
\&                $timers{\*(AqHiHat\*(Aq} ||= AE::timer 0, 0.5, delayed {
\&                    content "Tss...\en";
\&                };
\&
\&                content "Bap!\en";
\&
\&                if ( $count\-\- == 0 ) {
\&                    %timers = ();
\&                    content "Tugu tugu tugu dum!\en";
\&                    done;
\&
\&                    print "<enter sound of applause>\en\en";
\&                    $timers{\*(AqApplause\*(Aq} = AE::timer 3, 0, sub {
\&                        # the DSL will not available here
\&                        # because we didn\*(Aqt call the "delayed" keyword
\&                        print "<applause dies out>\en";
\&                    };
\&                }
\&            };
\&        };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
If an error happens during a write operation, a warning will be issued
to the logger.
.PP
You can handle the error yourself by providing an \f(CW\*(C`on_error\*(C'\fR handler:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        delayed {
\&            flush;
\&            content "works";
\&
\&            # ... user disconnected here ...
\&
\&            content "fails";
\&
\&            # ... error triggered ...
\&
\&            done; # doesn\*(Aqt even get run
\&        } on_error => sub {
\&            # delayed{} not needed, DSL already available
\&            my ($error) = @_;
\&            # do something with $error
\&        };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Here is an example that asynchronously streams the contents of a \s-1CSV\s0 file:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    use Dancer2;
\&    use Text::CSV_XS  qw< csv >;
\&    use Path::Tiny    qw< path >;
\&    use JSON::MaybeXS qw< encode_json >;
\&    # Create CSV parser
\&    my $csv = Text::CSV_XS\->new({
\&        binary    => 1,
\&        auto_diag => 1,
\&    });
\&    get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        # delayed response:
\&        delayed {
\&            # streaming content
\&            flush;
\&            # Read each row and stream it in JSON
\&            my $fh = path(\*(Aqfilename.csv\*(Aq)\->openr_utf8;
\&            while ( my $row = $csv\->getline($fh) ) {
\&                content encode_json $row;
\&            }
\&            # close user connection
\&            done;

\&            warning \*(AqFailed to stream to user: \*(Aq . request\->remote_address;
\&        };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR If you just want to send a file's contents asynchronously,
use \f(CW\*(C`send_file($filename)\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`delayed\*(C'\fR, as it will
automatically take advantage of any asynchronous capability.
.SS "Action Skipping"
.IX Subsection "Action Skipping"
An action can choose not to serve the current request and ask Dancer2 to
process the request with the next matching route.
.PP
This is done with the \fBpass\fR keyword, like in the following example
.PP
.Vb 4

For another example, this can be used along with session support to easily
give non-logged-in users a login page:

\&        }
\&    };
.Ve
.Sp
The request keyword returns the current Dancer2::Core::Request object
representing the incoming request.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`after\*(C'\fR hooks
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`after\*(C'\fR hooks are evaluated after the response has been built by a route
handler, and can alter the response itself, just before it's sent to the
client.
.Sp
This hook runs after a request has been processed, but before the response
is sent.
.Sp
It receives a Dancer2::Core::Response object, which it can modify if it
needs to make changes to the response which is about to be sent.
.Sp
The hook can use other keywords in order to do whatever it wants.
.Sp
.Vb 5

A route handler is a class that consumes the Dancer2::Core::Role::Handler
role. The class must implement a set of methods: \f(CW\*(C`methods\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`regexp\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR which will be used to declare the route.
.PP
Let's look at Dancer2::Handler::AutoPage for example.
.PP
First, the matching methods are \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`head\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    sub methods { qw(head get) }
.Ve
.PP
Then, the \f(CW\*(C`regexp\*(C'\fR or the \fIpath\fR we want to match:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    sub regexp { \*(Aq/:page\*(Aq }
.Ve
.PP
Anything will be matched by this route, since we want to check if there's
a view named with the value of the \f(CW\*(C`page\*(C'\fR token. If not, the route needs
to \f(CW\*(C`pass\*(C'\fR, letting the dispatching flow to proceed further.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    sub code {
\&        sub {
\&            my $app = shift;
\&            my $prefix = shift;
\&
\&            my $template = $app\->template_engine;
\&            if ( !defined $template ) {
\&                $app\->response\->has_passed(1);

\&            if ( $page =~ m{^/\eQ$layout_dir\eE/} ) {
\&                $app\->response\->has_passed(1);

\&        };
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR method passed the Dancer2::Core::App object which provides
access to anything needed to process the request.
.PP
A \f(CW\*(C`register\*(C'\fR is then implemented to add the route to the registry and if
the \f(CW\*(C`auto_page setting\*(C'\fR is off, it does nothing.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    sub register {
\&        my ($self, $app) = @_;
\&
\&        return unless $app\->config\->{auto_page};
\&
\&        $app\->add_route(
\&            method => $_,
\&            regexp => $self\->regexp,
\&            code   => $self\->code,
\&        ) for $self\->methods;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The config parser looks for a \f(CW\*(C`route_handlers\*(C'\fR section and any handler defined
there is loaded. Thus, any random handler can be added to your app.
For example, the default config file for any Dancer2 application is as follows:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    route_handlers:
\&      File:
\&        public_dir: /path/to/public

.SH "ERRORS"
.IX Header "ERRORS"
.SS "Error Pages"
.IX Subsection "Error Pages"
When an \s-1HTTP\s0 error occurs (the action responds with a status code other
than 200), Dancer2 first looks in the public directory for a corresponding
\&\s-1HTML\s0 file matching the error code (eg: 500.html or 404.html).
.PP
If such a file exists, it's used to report the error, otherwise, a default
error page will be rendered on the fly.
.PP
Note that in order to provide more informative diagnostics, the default
error page will override the error-code \s-1HTML\s0 files for errors with a \f(CW\*(C`5xx\*(C'\fR
status when \fBshow_errors\fR is set to true. For more information see
Dancer2::Config.
.SS "Execution Errors"
.IX Subsection "Execution Errors"
When an error occurs during the route execution, Dancer2 will render an
error page with the \s-1HTTP\s0 status code 500.
.PP
It's possible either to display the content of the error message or to hide
it with a generic error page.
.PP
This is a choice left to the end-user and can be set with the \fBshow_errors\fR

Note that you can also choose to consider all warnings in your route
handlers as errors when the setting \fBwarnings\fR is set to 1.

.IX Subsection "Handling sessions"
It's common to want to use sessions to give your web applications state; for
instance, allowing a user to log in, creating a session, and checking that
session on subsequent requests.
.PP
By default Dancer 2 has Simple sessions enabled.
It implements a very simple in-memory session storage. This will be fast and
useful for testing, but such sessions will not persist between restarts of
your app.
.PP
If you'd like to use a different session engine you must declare it in the
configuration file.
.PP
For example to use \s-1YAML\s0 file base sessions you need to add the following
to your \fIconfig.yml\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    session: YAML
.Ve
.PP
Or, to enable session support from within your code,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set session => \*(AqYAML\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
(However, controlling settings is best done from your config file.)
.PP
The Dancer2::Session::YAML backend implements a file-based \s-1YAML\s0 session
storage to help with debugging, but shouldn't be used on production systems.
.PP
There are other session backends, such as Dancer2::Session::Memcached,
which are recommended for production use.
.PP
You can then use the session keyword to manipulate the
session:
.PP
\fIStoring data in the session\fR

.Ve
.PP
\fIRetrieving data from the session\fR
.IX Subsection "Retrieving data from the session"
.PP
Retrieving data from the session is as easy as:

.Ve
.PP
Or, alternatively,
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    session\->read("varname")
.Ve
.PP
\fIControlling where sessions are stored\fR
.IX Subsection "Controlling where sessions are stored"
.PP
For disc-based session backends like Dancer2::Session::YAML,
Dancer2::Session::Storable etc., session files are written to the session
dir specified by the \f(CW\*(C`session_dir\*(C'\fR setting, which defaults to \f(CW\*(C`./sessions\*(C'\fR
if not specifically set.
.PP
If you need to control where session files are created, you can do so
quickly and easily within your config file, for example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    session: YAML
\&    engines:
\&      session:
\&        YAML:

A common requirement is to check the user is logged in, and, if not, require

In Dancer 2, a session backend consumes the role

First thing to do is to create the class for the session engine,
we'll name it \f(CW\*(C`Dancer2::Session::Redis\*(C'\fR:

\&     with \*(AqDancer2::Core::Role::SessionFactory\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
we want our backend to have a handle over a Redis connection.
To do that, we'll create an attribute \f(CW\*(C`redis\*(C'\fR
.PP
.Vb 3
\&     use JSON;

\&         builder => \*(Aq_build_redis\*(Aq,
\&     );
.Ve
.PP
The lazy attribute says to Moo that this attribute will be
built (initialized) only when called the first time. It means that
the connection to Redis won't be opened until necessary.
.PP
.Vb 8
\&     sub _build_redis {

Two more attributes, \f(CW\*(C`server\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`password\*(C'\fR need to be created.

\&       session:
\&         Redis:
\&           server: foo.mydomain.com
\&           password: S3Cr3t
.Ve
.PP
The server and password entries are now passed to the constructor
of the Redis session engine and can be accessed from there.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&     has server => (is => \*(Aqro\*(Aq, required => 1);
\&     has password => (is => \*(Aqro\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Next, we define the subroutine \f(CW\*(C`_retrieve\*(C'\fR which will return a session
object for a session \s-1ID\s0 it has passed. Since in this case, sessions are
going to be stored in Redis, the session \s-1ID\s0 will be the key, the session the value.
So retrieving is as easy as doing a get and decoding the \s-1JSON\s0 string returned:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&     sub _retrieve {
\&         my ($self, $session_id) = @_;
\&         my $json = $self\->redis\->get($session_id);
\&         my $hash = from_json( $json );
\&         return bless $hash, \*(AqDancer2::Core::Session\*(Aq;
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`_flush\*(C'\fR method is called by Dancer when the session needs to be stored in
the backend. That is actually a write to Redis. The method receives a \f(CW\*(C`Dancer2::Core::Session\*(C'\fR
object and is supposed to store it.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&     sub _flush {
\&         my ($self, $session) = @_;
\&         my $json = encode_json( { %{ $session } } );
\&         $self\->redis\->set($session\->id, $json);
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
For the \f(CW\*(C`_destroy\*(C'\fR method which is supposed to remove a session from the backend,
deleting the key from Redis is enough.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&     sub _destroy {
\&         my ($self, $session_id) = @_;
\&         $self\->redis\->del($session_id);
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`_sessions\*(C'\fR method which is supposed to list all the session IDs currently
stored in the backend is done by listing all the keys that Redis has.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&     sub _sessions {
\&         my ($self) = @_;
\&         my @keys = $self\->redis\->keys(\*(Aq*\*(Aq);
\&         return \e@keys;
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
The session engine is now ready.
.PP
\fIThe Session keyword\fR
.IX Subsection "The Session keyword"
.PP
Dancer2 maintains two session layers.
.PP
The first layer, Dancer2::Core::Session provides a session object
which represents the current session. You can read from it as many
times as you want, and write to it as many times as you want.
.PP
The second layer is the session engine (Dancer2::Session::Simple
is one example), which is used in order to implement the reading and
writing from the actual storage. This is read only once, when a request
comes in (using a cookie whose value is \f(CW\*(C`dancer.session\*(C'\fR by default).
At the end of a request, all the data you've written will be flushed
to the engine itself, which will do the actual write to the storage
(whether it's in a hash in memory, in Memcache, or in a database).
.SH "TEMPLATES"
.IX Header "TEMPLATES"
Returning plain content is all well and good for examples or trivial apps,
but soon you'll want to use templates to maintain separation between your
code and your content. Dancer2 makes this easy.
.PP
Your route handlers can use the template keyword
to render templates.
.SS "Views"
.IX Subsection "Views"
In Dancer2, a file which holds a template is called a \fIview\fR.  Views are
located in the \f(CW\*(C`appdir/views\*(C'\fR directory.
.PP
You can change this location by changing the setting 'views'. For instance
if your templates are located in the 'templates' directory, do the
following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set views => path( app\->location , \*(Aqtemplates\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
By default, the internal template engine Dancer2::Template::Simple is
used, but you may want to upgrade to Template
Toolkit <http://www.template-toolkit.org/>. If you do so, you have to enable
this engine in your settings as explained in
Dancer2::Template::TemplateToolkit and you'll also have to install the
Template module.
.PP
In order to render a view, just call the
template keyword at the end of the action by
giving the view name and the \s-1HASHREF\s0 of tokens to interpolate in the view
(note that for convenience, the request, session, params and vars are
automatically accessible in the view, named \f(CW\*(C`request\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`session\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`params\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`vars\*(C'\fR) \- for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    hook before => sub { var time => scalar(localtime) };
\&
\&    get \*(Aq/hello/:name\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my $name = route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqname\*(Aq);
\&        template \*(Aqhello.tt\*(Aq, { name => $name };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
The template \f(CW\*(C`hello.tt\*(C'\fR could contain, for example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    <p>Hi there, [% name %]!</p>
\&    <p>You\*(Aqre using [% request.user_agent %]</p>
\&    [% IF session.username %]
\&        <p>You\*(Aqre logged in as [% session.username %]</p>
\&    [% END %]
\&    It\*(Aqs currently [% vars.time %]
.Ve
.PP
For a full list of the tokens automatically added to your template (like
\&\f(CW\*(C`session\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`request\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`vars\*(C'\fR, refer to
Dancer2::Core::Role::Template).
.PP
By default, views use a \fI.tt\fR extension. This can be overridden by setting
the \f(CW\*(C`extension\*(C'\fR attribute in the template engine configuration:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    set engines => {
\&        template => {
\&            template_toolkit => {
\&                extension => \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq,
\&            },
\&        },
\&    };
.Ve
.SS "Layouts"
.IX Subsection "Layouts"
A layout is a special view, located in the \fIlayouts\fR directory (inside the
views directory) which must have a token named \f(CW\*(C`content\*(C'\fR. That token marks
the place where to render the action view. This lets you define a global
layout for your actions, and have each individual view contain only
specific content. This is a good thing and helps avoid lots of needless
duplication of \s-1HTML. :\s0)
.PP
For example, the layout \fIviews/layouts/main.tt\fR:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    <html>
\&        <head>...</head>
\&        <body>
\&        <div id="header">
\&        ...
\&        </div>
\&
\&        <div id="content">
\&        [% content %]
\&        </div>
\&
\&        </body>
\&    </html>
.Ve
.PP
You can tell your app which layout to use with \f(CW\*(C`layout: name\*(C'\fR in the config
file, or within your code:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set layout => \*(Aqmain\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
You can control which layout to use (or whether to use a layout at all) for
a specific request without altering the layout setting by passing an options
hashref as the third param to the template keyword:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    template \*(Aqindex.tt\*(Aq, {}, { layout => undef };
.Ve
.PP
If your application is not mounted under root (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR), you can use a
\&\f(CW\*(C`before_template_render\*(C'\fR hook instead of hardcoding the path into your
application for your \s-1CSS,\s0 images and JavaScript:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    hook before_template_render => sub {
\&        my $tokens = shift;
\&        $tokens\->{uri_base} = request\->base\->path;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Then in your layout, modify your \s-1CSS\s0 inclusion as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    <link rel="stylesheet" href="[% uri_base %]/css/style.css" />
.Ve
.PP
From now on you can mount your application wherever you want, without any
further modification of the \s-1CSS\s0 inclusion.
.SS "Encoding"
.IX Subsection "Encoding"
If you use Plack and have a Unicode problem with your Dancer2
application, don't forget to check if you have set your template engine to
use Unicode, and set the default charset to \s-1UTF\-8.\s0 So, if you are using
template toolkit, your config file will look like this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    charset: UTF\-8
\&    engines:
\&      template:
\&        template_toolkit:
\&          ENCODING: utf8
.Ve
.SH "STATIC FILES"
.IX Header "STATIC FILES"
.SS "Static Directory"
.IX Subsection "Static Directory"
Static files are served from the \fI./public\fR directory. You can specify a
different location by setting the \f(CW\*(C`public_dir\*(C'\fR option:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set public_dir => path( app\->location , \*(Aqstatic\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
When you modify default public_dir you have to set \f(CW\*(C`static_handler\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set static_handler => true;
.Ve
.PP
Note that the public directory name is not included in the \s-1URL. A\s0 file
\&\fI./public/css/style.css\fR is made available as
<http://example.com/css/style.css>.
.SS "Static File from a Route Handler"
.IX Subsection "Static File from a Route Handler"
It's possible for a route handler to send a static file, as follows:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    get \*(Aq/download/*\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my ($file) = splat;
\&
\&        send_file $file;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Or even if you want your index page to be a plain old \fIindex.html\fR file,
just do:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        send_file \*(Aq/index.html\*(Aq
\&    };
.Ve
.SH "FILE UPLOADS"
.IX Header "FILE UPLOADS"
Files are uploaded in Dancer2 using the class Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload.
The objects are accessible within the route handlers using the \f(CW\*(C`upload\*(C'\fR
keyword:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    post \*(Aq/upload\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my $upload     = upload(\*(Aqfile_input_name\*(Aq);    # upload object
\&        $upload\->copy_to(\*(AqUploads/\*(Aq);
\&    };
.Ve
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
.SS "Configuration and environments"
.IX Subsection "Configuration and environments"
Configuring a Dancer2 application can be done in many ways. The easiest one
(and maybe the dirtiest) is to put all your settings statements at the top
of your script, before calling the \f(CW\*(C`dance()\*(C'\fR method.
.PP
Other ways are possible: for example, you can define all your settings in the file
\&\f(CW\*(C`appdir/config.yml\*(C'\fR. For this, you must have installed the \s-1YAML\s0 module, and
of course, write the config file in \s-1YAML.\s0
.PP
That's better than the first option, but it's still not perfect as you can't
switch easily from an environment to another without rewriting the config
file.
.PP
A better solution is to have one \fIconfig.yml\fR file with default global
settings, like the following:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # appdir/config.yml
\&    logger: \*(Aqfile\*(Aq
\&    layout: \*(Aqmain\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
And then write as many environment files as you like in
\&\f(CW\*(C`appdir/environments\*(C'\fR. That way, the appropriate environment config file
will be loaded according to the running environment (if none is specified,
it will be 'development').
.PP
Note that you can change the running environment using the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-environment\*(C'\fR
command line switch.
.PP
Typically, you'll want to set the following values in a development config
file:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    # appdir/environments/development.yml
\&    log: \*(Aqdebug\*(Aq
\&    startup_info: 1
\&    show_errors:  1
.Ve
.PP
And in a production one:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    # appdir/environments/production.yml
\&    log: \*(Aqwarning\*(Aq
\&    startup_info: 0
\&    show_errors:  0
.Ve
.PP
Please note that you are not limited to writing configuration files in \s-1YAML.\s0
Dancer2 supports any file format that is supported by Config::Any, such
as \s-1JSON, XML, INI\s0 files, and Apache-style config files.
.SS "Accessing configuration information"
.IX Subsection "Accessing configuration information"
A Dancer2 application can use the \f(CW\*(C`config\*(C'\fR keyword to easily access the
settings within its config file, for instance:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/appname\*(Aq => sub {
\&        return "This is " . config\->{appname};
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
This makes keeping your application's settings all in one place simple and
easy \- you shouldn't need to worry about implementing all that yourself. :)
.SS "Settings"
.IX Subsection "Settings"
It's possible to change almost every parameter of the application via the
settings mechanism.
.PP
A setting is a key/value pair assigned by the keyword \fBset\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set setting_name => \*(Aqsetting_value\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
More usefully, settings can be defined in a configuration file.
Environment-specific settings can also be defined in environment-specific
files (for instance, you do not want to show error stacktraces in
production, and might want extra logging in development).
.SS "Serializers"
.IX Subsection "Serializers"
When writing a webservice, data serialization/deserialization is a common
issue to deal with. Dancer2 can automatically handle that for you, via a
serializer.
.PP
When setting up a serializer, a new behaviour is authorized for any route
handler you define: any non-scalar response will be rendered as a serialized
string, via the current serializer.
.PP
Here is an example of a route handler that will return a hashref:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use Dancer2;
\&    set serializer => \*(AqJSON\*(Aq;
\&
\&    get \*(Aq/user/:id/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        { foo => 42,
\&          number => 100234,
\&          list => [qw(one two three)],
\&        }
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Dancer2 will render the response via the current serializer.
.PP
Hence, with the \s-1JSON\s0 serializer set, the route handler above would result in
a content like the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    {"number":100234,"foo":42,"list":["one","two","three"]}
.Ve
.PP
If you send a value which is validated serialized data, but is not in the
form a key and value pair (such as a serialized string or a \s-1JSON\s0 array), the
data will not be available in \f(CW\*(C`params\*(C'\fR but will be available in
\&\f(CW\*(C`request\->data\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The following serializers are available, be aware they dynamically depend on
Perl modules you may not have on your system.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1JSON\s0\fR
.Sp
Requires \s-1JSON\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1YAML\s0\fR

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB\s-1XML\s0\fR
.Sp
Requires XML::Simple.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBMutable\fR
.Sp
Will try to find the appropriate serializer using the \fBContent-Type\fR and
\&\fBAccept-type\fR header of the request.
.SS "Importing using Appname"
.IX Subsection "Importing using Appname"
An app in Dancer2 uses the class name (defined by the \f(CW\*(C`package\*(C'\fR function) to
define the App name. Thus separating the App to multiple files, actually means
creating multiple applications. This means that any engine defined in an application,
because the application is a complete separate scope, will not be available to a
different application:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&     package MyApp::User {
\&         use Dancer2;
\&         set serializer => \*(AqJSON\*(Aq;
\&         get \*(Aq/view\*(Aq => sub {...};
\&     }
\&
\&     package MyApp::User::Edit {
\&         use Dancer2;
\&         get \*(Aq/edit\*(Aq => sub {...};
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
These are two different Dancer2 Apps. They have different scopes, contexts,
and thus different engines. While \f(CW\*(C`MyApp::User\*(C'\fR has a serializer defined,
\&\f(CW\*(C`MyApp::User::Edit\*(C'\fR will not have that configuration.
.PP
By using the import option \f(CW\*(C`appname\*(C'\fR, we can ask Dancer2 to extend an
App without creating a new one:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&     package MyApp::User {
\&         use Dancer2;
\&         set serializer => \*(AqJSON\*(Aq;
\&         get \*(Aq/view\*(Aq => sub {...};
\&     }
\&
\&     package MyApp::User::Edit {
\&         use Dancer2 appname => \*(AqMyApp::User\*(Aq; # extending MyApp::User
\&         get \*(Aq/edit\*(Aq => sub {...};
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
The import option \f(CW\*(C`appname\*(C'\fR allows you to seamlessly extend Dancer2 Apps
without creating unnecessary additional applications or repeat any definitions.
This allows you to spread your application routes across multiple files and allow
ease of mind when developing it, and accommodate multiple developers working
on the same codebase.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&     # app.pl
\&     use MyApp::User;
\&     use MyApp::User::Edit;
\&
\&     # single application composed of routes provided in multiple files
\&     MyApp::User\->to_app;
.Ve
.PP
This way only one class needs to be loaded while creating an app:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&     # app.pl:
\&     use MyApp::User;
\&     MyApp::User\->to_app;
.Ve
.SH "LOGGING"

It's possible to log messages generated by the application and by Dancer2
itself.
.PP
To start logging, select the logging engine you wish to use with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`logger\*(C'\fR setting; Dancer2 includes built-in log engines named \f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`console\*(C'\fR, which log to a logfile and to the console respectively.
.PP
To enable logging to a file, add the following to your config file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    logger: \*(Aqfile\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Then you can choose which kind of messages you want to actually log:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    log: \*(Aqcore\*(Aq      # will log debug, info, warnings, errors,
\&                     #   and messages from Dancer2 itself
\&    log: \*(Aqdebug\*(Aq     # will log debug, info, warning and errors
\&    log: \*(Aqinfo\*(Aq      # will log info, warning and errors
\&    log: \*(Aqwarning\*(Aq   # will log warning and errors
\&    log: \*(Aqerror\*(Aq     # will log only errors
.Ve
.PP
If you're using the \f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR logging engine, a directory \f(CW\*(C`appdir/logs\*(C'\fR will
be created and will host one logfile per environment. The log message
contains the time it was written, the \s-1PID\s0 of the current process, the
message and the caller information (file and line).

(which Dancer applications do), it will then convert it to a common web response
(as a standard HTTP::Response object).

\fIWhat it does\fR
.IX Subsection "What it does"
.PP
Carton sets up a local copy of your project prerequisites. You only
need to define them in a file and ask Carton to download all of them
and set them up.
When you want to deploy your app, you just carry the git clone and ask
Carton to set up the environment again and you will then be able to run it.
.PP
The benefits are multifold:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Local Directory copy
.Sp
By putting all the dependencies in a local directory, you can make
sure they aren't updated by someone else by accident and their versions
locked to the version you picked.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Sync versions
.Sp
Deciding which versions of the dependent modules your project needs
allows you to sync this with other developers as well. Now you're all
using the same version and they don't change unless you want update the
versions you want. When updated everyone again uses the same new version
of everything.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Carry only the requirement, not bundled modules
.Sp
Instead of bundling the modules, you only actually bundle the requirements.
Carton builds them for you when you need it.
.PP
\fISetting it up\fR
.IX Subsection "Setting it up"
.PP
First set up a new app:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&     $ dancer2 \-a MyApp
\&     ...
.Ve
.PP
Delete the files that are not needed:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ rm \-f Makefile.PL MANIFEST MANIFEST.SKIP
.Ve
.PP
Create a git repo:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ git init && git add . && git commit \-m "initial commit"
.Ve
.PP
Add a requirement using the cpanfile format:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&     $ cat > cpanfile
\&     requires \*(AqDancer2\*(Aq => 0.155000;
\&     requires \*(AqTemplate\*(Aq => 0;
\&     recommends \*(AqURL::Encode::XS\*(Aq => 0;
\&     recommends \*(AqCGI::Deurl::XS\*(Aq => 0;
\&     recommends \*(AqHTTP::Parser::XS\*(Aq => 0;
.Ve
.PP
Ask carton to set it up:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&     $ carton install
\&     Installing modules using [...]
\&     Successfully installed [...]
\&     ...
\&     Complete! Modules were install into [...]/local
.Ve
.PP
Now we have two files: \fIcpanfile\fR and \fIcpanfile.snapshot\fR. We
add both of them to our Git repository and we make sure we don't
accidentally add the \fIlocal/\fR directory Carton created which holds
the modules it installed:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&     $ echo local/ >> .gitignore
\&     $ git add .gitignore cpanfile cpanfile.snapshot
\&     $ git commit \-m "Start using carton"
.Ve
.PP
When we want to update the versions on the production machine,
we simply call:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ carton install \-\-deployment
.Ve
.PP
By using \-\-deployment we make sure we only install the modules
we have in our cpanfile.snapshot file and do not fallback to querying
the \s-1CPAN.\s0
.SS "FatPacker"
.IX Subsection "FatPacker"
App::FatPacker (using its command line interface, fatpack) packs
dependencies into a single file, allowing you to carry a single file
instead of a directory tree.
.PP
As long as your application is pure-Perl, you could create a single
file with your application and all of Dancer2 in it.
.PP
The following example will demonstrate how this can be done:
.PP
Assuming we have an application in \fIlib/MyApp.pm\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&     package MyApp;
\&     use Dancer2;
\&     get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {\*(AqOK\*(Aq};
\&     1;
.Ve
.PP
And we have a handler in \fIbin/app.pl\fR:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&     use strict;
\&     use warnings;
\&     use FindBin;
\&     use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";
\&     use MyApp;
\&
\&     MyApp\->to_app;
.Ve
.PP
To fatpack it, we begin by tracing the script:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ fatpack trace bin/app.pl
.Ve
.PP
This creates a \fIfatpacker.trace\fR file. From this we create the packlists:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ fatpack packlists\-for \`cat fatpacker.trace\` > packlists
.Ve
.PP
The packlists are stored in a file called \fIpacklists\fR.
.PP
Now we create the tree using the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ fatpack tree \`cat packlists\`
.Ve
.PP
The tree is created under the directory \fIfatlib\fR.
.PP
Now we create a file containing the dependency tree, and add our script to it,
using the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ (fatpack file; cat bin/app.pl) > myapp.pl
.Ve
.PP
This creates a file called \fImyapp.pl\fR with everything in it. Dancer2 uses
MIME::Types which has a database of all \s-1MIME\s0 types and helps translate those.
The small database file containing all of these types is a binary and therefore
cannot be fatpacked. Hence, it needs to be copied to the current directory so our
script can find it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     $ cp fatlib/MIME/types.db .
.Ve
.SH "MIDDLEWARES"
.IX Header "MIDDLEWARES"
.SS "Plack middlewares"
.IX Subsection "Plack middlewares"
If you want to use Plack middlewares, you need to enable them using
Plack::Builder as such:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    # in app.psgi or any other handler
\&    use Dancer2;
\&    use MyApp;
\&    use Plack::Builder;
\&
\&    builder {
\&        enable \*(AqDeflater\*(Aq;

\&        enable \*(AqDebug\*(Aq, panels => [ qw<DBITrace Memory Timer> ];
\&        dance;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
The nice thing about this setup is that it will work seamlessly through
Plack or through the internal web server.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # load dev web server (without middlewares)
\&    perl \-Ilib app.psgi
\&
\&    # load plack web server (with middlewares)

You do not need to provide different files for either server.
.PP

If you want to set up a middleware for a specific path, you can do that using

\&    use Dancer2;
\&    use MyApp;

.PP
Enabling content compression
.IX Subsection "Enabling content compression"
.PP
Content compression (gzip, deflate) can be easily enabled via a Plack
middleware (see \*(L"Plack::Middleware\*(R" in Plack): Plack::Middleware::Deflater.
It's a middleware to encode the response body in gzip or deflate, based on the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Accept\-Encoding\*(C'\fR \s-1HTTP\s0 request header.
.PP
Enable it as you would enable any Plack middleware. First you need to
install Plack::Middleware::Deflater, then in the handler (usually
\&\fIapp.psgi\fR) edit it to use Plack::Builder, as described above:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use Dancer2;
\&    use MyApp;
\&    use Plack::Builder;
\&
\&    builder {
\&        enable \*(AqDeflater\*(Aq;
\&        dance;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
To test if content compression works, trace the \s-1HTTP\s0 request and response
before and after enabling this middleware. Among other things, you should
notice that the response is gzip or deflate encoded, and contains a header
\&\f(CW\*(C`Content\-Encoding\*(C'\fR set to \f(CW\*(C`gzip\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`deflate\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIRunning multiple apps with Plack::Builder\fR
.IX Subsection "Running multiple apps with Plack::Builder"
.PP
You can use Plack::Builder to mount multiple Dancer2 applications on a
\&\s-1PSGI\s0 webserver like Starman.
.PP
Start by creating a simple app.psgi file:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    use OurWiki;  # first app
\&    use OurForum; # second app
\&    use Plack::Builder;
\&
\&    builder {
\&        mount \*(Aq/wiki\*(Aq  => OurWiki\->to_app;
\&        mount \*(Aq/forum\*(Aq => OurForum\->to_app;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
and now use Starman
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    plackup \-a app.psgi \-s Starman
.Ve
.PP
Currently this still demands the same appdir for both (default circumstance)
but in a future version this will be easier to change while staying very
simple to mount.
.PP
\fIRunning from Apache with Plack\fR
.IX Subsection "Running from Apache with Plack"
.PP
You can run your app from Apache using \s-1PSGI \s0(Plack), with a config like the
following:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    <VirtualHost myapp.example.com>
\&        ServerName www.myapp.example.com

.IX Subsection "Writing a plugin"
See \*(L"Writing the plugin\*(R" in Dancer2::Plugin for information on how to author
a new plugin for Dancer2.
.SH "EXPORTS"
.IX Header "EXPORTS"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`use Dancer2\*(C'\fR exports all the \s-1DSL\s0 keywords and sets up the
webapp under the name of the current package. The following tags control
exports and webapp namespace.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB!keyword\fR
.Sp
If you want to prevent Dancer2 from exporting specific keywords (perhaps you
plan to implement them yourself in a different way, or they clash with
another module you're loading), you can simply exclude them:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use Test::More;
\&    use Dancer2 qw(!pass);
.Ve
.Sp
The above would import all keywords as usual, with the exception of \f(CW\*(C`pass\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBappname\fR
.Sp
A larger application may split its source between several packages to aid
maintainability. Dancer2 will create a separate application for each
package, each having separate hooks, config and/or engines. You can force
Dancer2 to collect the route and hooks into a single application with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`appname\*(C'\fR tag; e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    package MyApp;
\&    use Dancer2;
\&    get \*(Aq/foo\*(Aq => sub {...};
\&
\&    package MyApp::Private;
\&    use Dancer2 appname => MyApp;
\&    get \*(Aq/bar\*(Aq => sub {...};
.Ve
.Sp
The above would add the \f(CW\*(C`bar\*(C'\fR route to the MyApp application. Dancer2 will
\&\fInot\fR create an application with the name \f(CW\*(C`MyApp::Private\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB:nopragmas\fR
.Sp
By default Dancer2 will import three pragmas: strict, warnings,
and utf8. If you require control over the imported pragmas, you can add
\&\fB:nopragmas\fR to the importing flags, in which case Dancer2 will not import
any pragmas:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    use strict;
\&    use warnings;
\&    no warnings \*(Aqexperimental::smartmatch\*(Aq; # for example...
\&    use Dancer2 \*(Aq:nopragmas\*(Aq; # do not touch the existing pragmas
.Ve
.Sp
This way importing \f(CW\*(C`Dancer2\*(C'\fR does not change the existing pragmas setup
you have.
.PP
When you \f(CW\*(C`use Dancer2\*(C'\fR, you get an \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR method added into the current
package. This \fBwill\fR override previously declared import methods from other
sources, such as Exporter. Dancer2 applications support the following
tags on import:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fBwith\fR
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`with\*(C'\fR tag allows an app to pass one or more config entries to another
app, when it \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fRs it.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    package MyApp;
\&    use Dancer2;
\&
\&    BEGIN { set session => \*(AqYAML\*(Aq };
\&    use Blog with => { session => engine(\*(Aqsession\*(Aq) };
.Ve
.Sp
In this example, the session engine is passed to the \f(CW\*(C`Blog\*(C'\fR app. That way,
anything done in the session will be shared between both apps.
.Sp
Anything that is defined in the config entry can be passed that way. If we
want to pass the whole config object, it can be done like so:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use SomeApp with => { %{config()} };
.Ve
.SH "DSL KEYWORDS"

Given a namespace, returns the current engine object
.PP
.Vb 3

Logs a message of error level:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    error "This is an error message";
.Ve
.PP
See Dancer2::Core::Role::Logger for details on how to configure where log
messages go.
.SS "false"
.IX Subsection "false"
Constant that returns a false value (0).
.SS "forward"
.IX Subsection "forward"
Runs an \*(L"internal redirect\*(R" of the current route to another route. More
formally; when \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR is executed, the current dispatch of the route is
aborted, the request is modified (altering query params or request method),
and the modified request following a new route is dispatched again. Any
remaining code (route and hooks) from the current dispatch will never be run
and the modified route's dispatch will execute hooks for the new route normally.
.PP
It effectively lets you chain routes together in a clean manner.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    get \*(Aq/demo/articles/:article_id\*(Aq => sub {
\&
\&        # you\*(Aqll have to implement this next sub yourself :)
\&        change_the_main_database_to_demo();
\&
\&        forward "/articles/" . route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqarticle_id\*(Aq);
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
In the above example, the users that reach \fI/demo/articles/30\fR will
actually reach \fI/articles/30\fR but we've changed the database to demo
before.
.PP
This is pretty cool because it lets us retain our paths and offer a demo
database by merely going to \fI/demo/...\fR.
.PP
You'll notice that in the example we didn't indicate whether it was \fB\s-1GET\s0\fR
or \fB\s-1POST\s0\fR. That is because \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR chains the same type of route the
user reached. If it was a \fB\s-1GET\s0\fR, it will remain a \fB\s-1GET\s0\fR (but if you do
need to change the method, you can do so; read on below for details.)
.PP
Also notice that \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR only redirects to a new route. It does not redirect
the requests involving static files. This is because static files are handled
before Dancer2 tries to match the request to a route \- static files take
higher precedence.
.PP
This means that you will not be able to \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR to a static file. If you
wish to do so, you have two options: either redirect (asking the browser to
make another request, but to a file path instead) or use \f(CW\*(C`send_file\*(C'\fR to
provide a file.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1WARNING:\s0\fR Any code after a \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR is ignored, until the end of the
route. It's not necessary to use \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR anymore.
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    get \*(Aq/foo/:article_id\*(Aq => sub {
\&        if ($condition) {
\&            forward "/articles/" . route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqarticle_id\*(Aq);

\&            do_stuff();
\&        }
\&
\&        more_stuff();
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR doesn't parse \s-1GET\s0 arguments. So, you can't use
something like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    forward \*(Aq/home?authorized=1\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
But \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR supports an optional hashref with parameters to be added to
the actual parameters:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    forward \*(Aq/home\*(Aq, { authorized => 1 };
.Ve
.PP
Finally, you can add some more options to the \f(CW\*(C`forward\*(C'\fR method, in a third
argument, also as a hashref. That option is currently only used to change
the method of your request. Use with caution.
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
Note that a route to match \fB\s-1HEAD\s0\fR requests is automatically created as well.
.SS "halt"
.IX Subsection "halt"
Sets a response object with the content given.
.PP
When used as a return value from a hook, this breaks the execution flow and
renders the response immediately:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    hook before => sub {
\&        if ($some_condition) {
\&            halt("Unauthorized");

\&    };
\&
\&    get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        "hello there";
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
\&\fB\s-1WARNING:\s0\fR Issuing a halt immediately exits the current route, and performs
the halt. Thus, any code after a halt is ignored, until the end of the route.
Hence, it's not necessary anymore to use \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR with halt.

Shortcut to access the instance object of Dancer2::Core::MIME. You should

\&        send_file( route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqfile\*(Aq), streaming => 0 );
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
The content-type will be set depending on the current \s-1MIME\s0 types definition
(see \f(CW\*(C`mime\*(C'\fR if you want to define your own).
.PP
If your filename does not have an extension, you are passing in a filehandle,
or you need to force a specific mime type, you can pass it to \f(CW\*(C`send_file\*(C'\fR
as follows:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    send_file(route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqfile\*(Aq), content_type => \*(Aqimage/png\*(Aq);
\&    send_file($fh, content_type => \*(Aqimage/png\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
Also, you can use your aliases or file extension names on \f(CW\*(C`content_type\*(C'\fR,
like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    send_file(route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqfile\*(Aq), content_type => \*(Aqpng\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
The encoding of the file or filehandle may be specified by passing both
the \f(CW\*(C`content_type\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`charset\*(C'\fR options. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    send_file($fh, content_type => \*(Aqtext/csv\*(Aq, charset => \*(Aqutf\-8\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
For files outside your \fBpublic\fR folder, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`system_path\*(C'\fR
switch. Just bear in mind that its use needs caution as it can be dangerous.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   send_file(\*(Aq/etc/passwd\*(Aq, system_path => 1);
.Ve
.PP
If you have your data in a scalar variable, \f(CW\*(C`send_file\*(C'\fR can be useful as
well. Pass a reference to that scalar, and \f(CW\*(C`send_file\*(C'\fR will behave as if
there was a file with that contents:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   send_file( \e$data, content_type => \*(Aqimage/png\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
Note that Dancer is unable to guess the content type from the data contents.
Therefore you might need to set the \f(CW\*(C`content_type\*(C'\fR properly. For this kind
of usage an attribute named \f(CW\*(C`filename\*(C'\fR can be useful. It is used as the
Content-Disposition header, to hint the browser about the filename it should
use.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   send_file( \e$data, content_type => \*(Aqimage/png\*(Aq
\&                      filename     => \*(Aqonion.png\*(Aq );
.Ve
.SS "set"
.IX Subsection "set"
Defines a setting:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set something => \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
You can set more than one value at once:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    set something => \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq, otherthing => \*(Aqothervalue\*(Aq;
.Ve
.SS "setting"
.IX Subsection "setting"
Returns the value of a given setting:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    setting(\*(Aqsomething\*(Aq); # \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq
.Ve
.SS "session"
.IX Subsection "session"
Provides access to all data stored in the user's session (if any).
.PP
It can also be used as a setter to store data in the session:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    # getter example
\&    get \*(Aq/user\*(Aq => sub {
\&        if (session(\*(Aquser\*(Aq)) {
\&            return "Hello, ".session(\*(Aquser\*(Aq)\->name;
\&        }
\&    };
\&
\&    # setter example
\&    post \*(Aq/user/login\*(Aq => sub {
\&        ...
\&        if ($logged_in) {
\&            session user => $user;
\&        }
\&        ...
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
You may also need to clear a session:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    # destroy session
\&    get \*(Aq/logout\*(Aq => sub {
\&        ...
\&        app\->destroy_session;
\&        ...
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
If you need to fetch the session \s-1ID\s0 being used for any reason:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $id = session\->id;
.Ve
.SS "splat"
.IX Subsection "splat"
Returns the list of captures made from a route handler with a route pattern
which includes wildcards:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/file/*.*\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my ($file, $extension) = splat;
\&        ...
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
There is also the extensive splat (A.K.A. \*(L"megasplat\*(R"), which allows
extensive greedier matching, available using two asterisks. The additional
path is broken down and returned as an arrayref:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/entry/*/tags/**\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my ( $entry_id, $tags ) = splat;
\&        my @tags = @{$tags};
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`splat\*(C'\fR keyword in the above example for the route \fI/entry/1/tags/one/two\fR
would set \f(CW$entry_id\fR to \f(CW1\fR and \f(CW$tags\fR to \f(CW\*(C`[\*(Aqone\*(Aq, \*(Aqtwo\*(Aq]\*(C'\fR.
.SS "start"
.IX Subsection "start"
Starts the application or the standalone server (depending on the deployment
choices).
.PP
This keyword should be called at the very end of the script, once all routes
are defined. At this point, Dancer2 takes over.
.SS "to_app"
.IX Subsection "to_app"
Returns the \s-1PSGI\s0 coderef for the current (and only the current) application.
.PP
You can call it as a method on the class or as a \s-1DSL:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $app = MyApp\->to_app;
\&
\&    # or
\&
\&    my $app = to_app;
.Ve
.PP
There is a
Dancer Advent Calendar article <http://advent.perldancer.org/2014/9> covering
this keyword and its usage further.
.SS "psgi_app"
.IX Subsection "psgi_app"
Provides the same functionality as \f(CW\*(C`to_app\*(C'\fR but uses the deprecated
Dispatcher engine. You should use \f(CW\*(C`to_app\*(C'\fR instead.
.SS "status"
.IX Subsection "status"
Changes the status code provided by an action. By default, an action will
produce an \f(CW\*(C`HTTP 200 OK\*(C'\fR status code, meaning everything is \s-1OK:\s0
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    get \*(Aq/download/:file\*(Aq => {
\&        if (! \-f route_parameters\->get(\*(Aqfile\*(Aq)) {
\&            status \*(Aqnot_found\*(Aq;
\&            return "File does not exist, unable to download";
\&        }
\&        # serving the file...
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
In that example, Dancer will notice that the status has changed, and will
render the response accordingly.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`status\*(C'\fR keyword receives either a numeric status code or its name in
lower case, with underscores as a separator for blanks \- see the list in
\&\*(L"\s-1HTTP CODES\*(R"\s0 in Dancer2::Core::HTTP. As an example, The above call translates
to setting the code to \f(CW404\fR.
.SS "template"
.IX Subsection "template"
Returns the response of processing the given template with the given
parameters (and optional settings), wrapping it in the default or specified
layout too, if layouts are in use.
.PP
An example of a  route handler which returns the result of using template to
build a response with the current template engine:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        ...
\&        return template \*(Aqsome_view\*(Aq, { token => \*(Aqvalue\*(Aq};
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Note that \f(CW\*(C`template\*(C'\fR simply returns the content, so when you use it in a
route handler, if execution of the route handler should stop at that point,
make sure you use \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR to ensure your route handler returns the content.
.PP
Since \f(CW\*(C`template\*(C'\fR just returns the result of rendering the template, you can
also use it to perform other templating tasks, e.g. generating emails:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    post \*(Aq/some/route\*(Aq => sub {
\&        if (...) {
\&            email {
\&                to      => \*(Aqsomeone@example.com\*(Aq,
\&                from    => \*(Aqfoo@example.com\*(Aq,
\&                subject => \*(AqHello there\*(Aq,
\&                msg     => template(\*(Aqemails/foo\*(Aq, { name => body_parameters\->get(\*(Aqname\*(Aq) }),
\&            };
\&
\&            return template \*(Aqmessage_sent\*(Aq;
\&        } else {
\&            return template \*(Aqerror\*(Aq;
\&        }
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Compatibility notice: \f(CW\*(C`template\*(C'\fR was changed in version 1.3090 to
immediately interrupt execution of a route handler and return the content,
as it's typically used at the end of a route handler to return content.
However, this caused issues for some people who were using \f(CW\*(C`template\*(C'\fR to
generate emails etc, rather than accessing the template engine directly, so
this change has been reverted in 1.3091.
.PP
The first parameter should be a template available in the views directory,
the second one (optional) is a hashref of tokens to interpolate, and the
third (again optional) is a hashref of options.
.PP
For example, to disable the layout for a specific request:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        template \*(Aqindex\*(Aq, {}, { layout => undef };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Or to request a specific layout, of course:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    get \*(Aq/user\*(Aq => sub {
\&        template \*(Aquser\*(Aq, {}, { layout => \*(Aquser\*(Aq };
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Some tokens are automatically added to your template (\f(CW\*(C`perl_version\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`dancer_version\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`settings\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`request\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`query_parameters\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`body_parameters\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`route_parameters\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`vars\*(C'\fR and, if you
have sessions enabled, \f(CW\*(C`session\*(C'\fR). Check Dancer2::Core::Role::Template
for further details.
.SS "to_dumper ($structure)"
.IX Subsection "to_dumper ($structure)"
Serializes a structure with Data::Dumper.
.PP
Calling this function will \fBnot\fR trigger the serialization's hooks.
.SS "to_json ($structure, \e%options)"
.IX Subsection "to_json ($structure, %options)"
Serializes a structure to \s-1JSON.\s0 You should probably use \f(CW\*(C`encode_json\*(C'\fR instead
which handles encoding the result for you.
.SS "to_yaml ($structure)"
.IX Subsection "to_yaml ($structure)"
Serializes a structure to \s-1YAML.\s0
.PP
Calling this function will \fBnot\fR trigger the serialization's hooks.
.SS "true"
.IX Subsection "true"
Constant that returns a true value (1).
.SS "upload"
.IX Subsection "upload"
Provides access to file uploads. Any uploaded file is accessible as a
Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload object. You can access all parsed uploads
via:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    post \*(Aq/some/route\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my $file = upload(\*(Aqfile_input_foo\*(Aq);
\&        # $file is a Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload object
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
If you named multiple inputs of type \*(L"file\*(R" with the same name, the \f(CW\*(C`upload\*(C'\fR
keyword would return an Array of Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload objects:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    post \*(Aq/some/route\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my ($file1, $file2) = upload(\*(Aqfiles_input\*(Aq);
\&        # $file1 and $file2 are Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload objects
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
You can also access the raw hashref of parsed uploads via the current
\&\f(CW\*(C`request\*(C'\fR object:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    post \*(Aq/some/route\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my $all_uploads = request\->uploads;
\&        # $all_uploads\->{\*(Aqfile_input_foo\*(Aq} is a Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload object
\&        # $all_uploads\->{\*(Aqfiles_input\*(Aq} is an arrayref of Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload objects
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Note that you can also access the filename of the upload received via the
\&\f(CW\*(C`body_parameters\*(C'\fR keyword:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    post \*(Aq/some/route\*(Aq => sub {
\&        # body_parameters\->get(\*(Aqfiles_input\*(Aq) is the filename of the file uploaded
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
See Dancer2::Core::Request::Upload for details about the interface provided.
.SS "uri_for"
.IX Subsection "uri_for"
Returns a fully-qualified \s-1URI\s0 for the given path:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/\*(Aq => sub {
\&        redirect uri_for(\*(Aq/path\*(Aq);
\&        # can be something like: http://localhost:5000/path
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Query string parameters can be provided by passing a hashref as a second param:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    uri_for(\*(Aq/path\*(Aq, { foo => \*(Aqbar\*(Aq });
\&    # would return e.g. http://localhost:5000/path?foo=bar
.Ve
.PP
By default, the parameters will be \s-1URL\s0 encoded:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    uri_for(\*(Aq/path\*(Aq, { foo => \*(Aqhope;faith\*(Aq });
\&    # would return http://localhost:5000/path?foo=hope%3Bfaith
.Ve
.PP
If desired (for example, if you've already encoded your query
parameters and you want to prevent double encoding) you can disable
\&\s-1URL\s0 encoding via a third parameter:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    uri_for(\*(Aq/path\*(Aq, { foo => \*(Aqqux%3Dquo\*(Aq }, 1);
\&    # would return http://localhost:5000/path?foo=qux%3Dquo
.Ve
.SS "captures"
.IX Subsection "captures"
Returns a reference to a copy of \f(CW\*(C`%+\*(C'\fR, if there are named captures in the
route's regular expression.
.PP
Named captures are a feature of Perl 5.10, and are not supported in earlier
versions:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    get qr{
\&        / (?<object> user   | ticket | comment )
\&        / (?<action> delete | find )
\&        / (?<id> \ed+ )
\&        /?$
\&    }x
\&    , sub {
\&        my $value_for = captures;
\&        "i don\*(Aqt want to $$value_for{action} the $$value_for{object} $$value_for{id} !"
\&    };
.Ve
.SS "var"
.IX Subsection "var"
Provides an accessor for variables shared between hooks and route
handlers. Given a key/value pair, it sets a variable:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    hook before => sub {
\&        var foo => 42;
\&    };
.Ve
.PP
Later, route handlers and other hooks will be able to read that variable:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    get \*(Aq/path\*(Aq => sub {
\&        my $foo = var \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&        ...
\&    };
.Ve
.SS "vars"
.IX Subsection "vars"
Returns the hashref of all shared variables set during the hook/route
chain with the \f(CW\*(C`var\*(C'\fR keyword:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    get \*(Aq/path\*(Aq => sub {
\&        if (vars\->{foo} eq 42) {
\&            ...
\&        }
\&    };
.Ve
.SS "warning"
.IX Subsection "warning"
Logs a warning message through the current logger engine:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    warning "This is a warning";
.Ve
.PP
See Dancer2::Core::Role::Logger for details on how to configure where log
messages go.
